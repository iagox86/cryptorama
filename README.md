Cryptorama!

This is a fun series of crypto challenges that I designed to go along with
[a crypto workshop](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1rF_Wn1t31lK-EXofOAT58nDc7ZUDSGSt)
I created.

# Running

The easiest way to run this is to use docker. Then just run...


```
make install
make run
```

...as any user in the local `docker` group.

# Challenges

See the [src/](src/) folder for the application source code.

# Solutions
