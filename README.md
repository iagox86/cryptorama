Cryptorama!

This is a fun series of crypto challenges that I designed to go along with
[a crypto workshop](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nJB-PbDxTDDZFniFW1N3-N7stVavPe9bP7MMZgGbCvc)
I created.

# Running

The easiest way to run this is to use docker. With docker installed and running,
run...


```
make && make run
```

...as any user in the local `docker` group.

# Challenges

See the [src/](src/) folder for the application source code and
[solution/](solution/) for solutions.

TODO: Outline the challenges here
