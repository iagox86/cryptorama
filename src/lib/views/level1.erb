  Good news everyone! The package you were supposed to deliver is missing!
</p>

<p>
  Why's that good news? Isn't it obvious? It means we can finally put your
  hacking skills to good use!
</p>

<p>
  Fortunately, the person who stole our package dropped a piece of paper.
  Unfortunately, it is in some kind of code!
</p>

<p>
  Can you use your new-found cryptanalysis skills to decrypt it?

<div class='level level1 rounded'>
  <%= erb(:message_box, :locals => { completed: completed, messages: messages, errors: errors }) %>

  <p><%=         "Evil plan notes..."                                          %></p>
  <p><%= base64( "First, I steal the very special package from the Professor") %></p>
  <p><%= hex(    "Next, I ransom it back")                                     %></p>
  <p><%= ascii(  "And stop living in a dumpster!")                             %></p>
  <p><%= hex2(   "I will finally have money, or my name isn't...")             %></p>
  <p><%= base32( "...oh ha ha ha, almost revealed my name!")                   %></p>
